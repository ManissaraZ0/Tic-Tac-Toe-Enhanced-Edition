# Tic-Tac-Toe Enhanced Edition
## Project Overview
This project is a personalized implementation and extension of the Python Tic-Tac-Toe game originally developed by Alejandro González D.. While the core mechanics are based on the original source, I have significantly expanded the project by adding new gameplay functionalities, a more robust navigation system, and a completely custom visual design.

## Key Features
**1. Functional Enhancements**
* **Player Customization:** Added a system for players to input custom names for both Player 1 and Player 2.

* **Round Selection:** Players can now choose the number of rounds to play in a single session (e.g., Best of 3, Best of 5).

* **Improved Win Logic:** Refined the win-checking algorithm to handle multi-round matches and score tracking.

* **Audio Integration:** Added immersive sound effects for game actions and background music to enhance the atmosphere.

* **Theme Selection:** Implemented a system allowing players to switch between different color schemes and styles during gameplay.

* **Enhanced Navigation (Multi-Screen Support):** Developed a structured UI flow including:

   * **Home Screen:** The main entry point of the game.

   * **Main Game:** The primary interactive game board.

   * **Draw Screen:** A dedicated result screen for tied matches.

   * **Source/Credit Screen:** A page to display project information and acknowledge the original creator.

**2. UI/UX & Visual Design**
I have completely overhauled the visual identity of the game to provide a more polished and modern look:
* **Original Assets:** Custom-designed Logo, Icons, and Backgrounds.
* **Dynamic Themes:** Carefully curated color palettes for the theme selection feature.
* **Layout Design:** Improved the overall layout for better user interaction and visual balance.

## Tech Stack
